Hi! I'm a regular undergrad student just trying to have some fun. 

I like to implement things from scratch. At the same time, I write small tutorials so others can build things too. I am interested in Natural Language Processing and ML related stuff. 

If you are interested in working together.

Thanks for checking this out!
