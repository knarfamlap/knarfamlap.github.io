Hello! I recently graduated from CUNY Queens College where I dabbled with Computer Science and Mathematics.
I work on things related to machine learning, deep learning, and natural langauge processing. 
In the past, I've worked on using language models for educational applications. 
Recently, I was a Student Researcher at Google. Here is my resume **[resume](resume.pdf)**.
