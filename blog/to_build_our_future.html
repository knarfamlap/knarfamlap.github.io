        To Build Our Future, We Must Know Our Past:
        Contextualizing Paradigm Shifts in Natural Language Processing
    </h1>

        Authors hosted interviews with various NLP researchers in
        junior, mid, and senior levels. There are many intresting
        sections, but the most that resonates with me were the
        'Exploit-explore cycles of work' and 'Benchmarking culture'.
        Exploit-explore cycles of work discuss how in NLP there are
        seminal works that create a lot of intrest in certain areas
        which results in the entire community flooding into it and
        attempting to reach for the low hanging fruit. These are
        great oportunities for junior researchers, but in the longer
        run are papers that are not very intresting and explore
        obvious things. After all the fruit has been picked, there
        are the less obvious works that could perhaps change the way
        we viewed that seminical approach. I find this intresting
        because its what I'm currently going through. I see a cool
        idea and I'm excited by all these ideas that come to my head
        but more likely than not they have been explored and are not as
        intresting. It makes me want to take my ideas and fully think
        them through before I go and pursue anything. But the constant
        ticking clock in the background keeps telling that I must be
        churning things out every time despite them being not good
        quality. 'Benchmarking-culture' is also intresting because
        recently I've been feeling like NLP has lost its connection
        to the practical aspect of the world. The papers we write
        are always attempting to reach the new best score despite this
        score having zero correlation with how the technology will be
        used by actual humans. The literature is filled with ChatGPT
        benchmarks and evaluations that don't really tell us how we
        should advance the subfield, rather it tells us what are the
        mistakes are commerical models doing. I think NLP is at an
        intresting place and currently I dont fully love it, but I hope
        these hessitations allow me on projects that are more people
        oriented.
